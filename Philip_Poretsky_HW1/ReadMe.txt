LXRinstall.sh is made for Ubuntu systems. It was tested through a container.

Run the script via sudo ./LXRinstall.sh 
You will need memorize the path you made for your source directory and glimpse db. 
When prompted, user will need to go through the initial configuration, and do some inputs such as hitting return, typing up names, and the directory.
When asked for version name, enter "v1"

When the process is done it is up to the user to find the kernel they are looking for and put it in their source directory's v1 directory.
Then run the genxscript again, which this script will prompt you on the right command. This can take some time, but when done go to 
http://localhost/lxr/source 

Enjoy!
